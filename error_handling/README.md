*** ReferenceError: ***
Encounter a ReferenceError because i tried to parse a variable named json which is not  defined anywhere in my code. (use the variable data instead)

***Error Handling: ***
Implement error handling for reading the file.However, it's also a good practice to handle errors that may occur during JSON parsing.

***Specific error messages***
adding more specific error messages to make debugging easier.
